-- | Simple (stateful) Model-Based Testing library for use with Haskell QuickCheck.
--
-- This module provides the basic machinery to define a `StateModel` from which /traces/ can
-- be generated and executed against some /actual/ implementation code to define monadic `Property`
-- to be asserted by QuickCheck.

-- | The typeclass users implement to define a model against which to validate some implementation.
--
-- To implement a `StateModel`, user needs to provide at least the following:
--
--   * A datatype for `Action`s: Each test case is a sequence of `Action`s that's supposed to lead from
--     some `initialState` to some end state,
--   * A generator for traces of `Action`s, the `arbitraryAction` function,
--   * An `initialState`,
--   * A /transition/ function, `nextState`, that "interprets" each `Action` and producing some new `state`.
--
-- For finer grained control over the testing process, one can also define:
--
--  * `shrinkAction`: Shrinking is an important part of MBT as it allows QuickCheck engine to look for simpler
--    test cases when something goes wrong which makes troubleshooting easier,
--  * `precondition`: Filters generated `Action` depending on the `state`. When `precondition` is False then
--    the action is /rejected/ and a new one is tried. This is also useful when shrinking a trace
--    in order to ensure that removing some `Action` still produces a valid trace. The `precondition` can be
--    somewhat redundant with the generator's conditions,
class
  ( forall a. Show (Action state a)

  ) =>
  StateModel state
  where
  -- | The type of `Action` relevant for this `state`.
  --
  -- This is expected to be defined as a GADT where the `a` parameter is instantiated to some
  -- observable output from the SUT a given action is expected to produce. For example, here
  -- is a fragment of the `Action RegState` (taken from the `Spec.Dynamic.RegistryModel`  module) :
  --
  -- @
  --   data Action RegState a where
  --     Spawn      ::                           Action RegState ThreadId
  --     Register   :: String -> Var ThreadId -> Action RegState (Either ErrorCall ())
  --     KillThread :: Var ThreadId           -> Action RegState ()
  -- @
  --
  -- The @Spawn@ action should produce a @ThreadId@, whereas the @KillThread@ action does not return
  -- anything.
  data Action state a

  -- | Display name for `Action`.
  -- This is useful to provide sensible statistics about the distribution of `Action`s run
  -- when checking a property.

  -- Default implementation uses a poor-man's string manipulation method to extract the
  -- constructor name from the value.
  actionName :: Action state a -> String
  actionName = head . words . show

  -- | Generator for `Action` depending on `state`.
  -- The generated values are wrapped in `Any` type to allow the model to /not/ generate an action under
  -- some circumstances: Any generated  `Error` value will be ignored when generating a trace for testing.
  arbitraryAction :: state -> Gen (Any (Action state))

  -- | Shrinker for `Action`.
  -- Defaults to no-op but as usual, defining a good shrinker greatly enhances the usefulness
  -- of property-based testing.

  -- | Initial state of generated traces.
  initialState :: state

  -- | Transition function for the model.
  -- The `Var a` parameter is useful to keep reference to actual value of type `a` produced
  -- by `perform`ing the `Action` inside the `state` so that further actions can use `Lookup`
  -- to retrieve that data. This allows the model to be ignorant of those values yet maintain
  -- some references that can be compared and looked for.
  nextState :: state -> Action state a -> Var a -> state
  nextState s _ _ = s

  -- | Precondition for filtering generated `Action`.
  -- This function is applied before the action is performed, it is useful to refine generators that
  -- can produce more values than are useful.

  -- output from the `Action` that should later be kept in the
